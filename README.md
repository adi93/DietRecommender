Creating a diet recommender app. It takes preferences from user, in terms of body weight, age, or any vitamin deficiencies, etc. It also takes dietery preference of useer, like for a vegetarian, non vegetarian, lacto vegetarian, etc. Based on the above two inputs, it recommends a diet which fulfils the necessary nutritional requirement.

Additional features for future:
1. Modeling nutritional value of food as a probability function, rather than a fixed amount.
2. If two or more diets are equally good, than picking the cheaper diet based on price.
